# clojure-bot

Requires that you have Java and Leiningen installed.

To use in repl: `lein repl`
To run: `lein run`

If you want to run against a local game server, start with env variable `ENV=development`. By default the bot will connect to the game server in the cloud.

Api calls to game server are implemented in api.clj.

Go ahead and implement your bot in core.clj! Enjoy!
